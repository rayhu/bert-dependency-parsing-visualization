# BERT Attention Visualization

This project visualizes BERT's attention weights using network graphs. It helps understand how different layers and attention heads in BERT process and relate different tokens in a sentence.

## Environment Setup

### Option 1: Using Conda (Recommended)

1. Create a new conda environment:
   ```bash
    conda env create -f environment.yml
   ```

2. Activate the environment:
